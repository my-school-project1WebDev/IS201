        <p>I am of the opinion that one should work hard and play hard. I love my work, but now and then, I really enjoy spending time on interests and hobbies.
            I especially love trying and learning new things, so when I get the chance to explore a new interest or visit a new place, it really feels elevating.
            So, I'd like to share a little bit of that with you.</p><br>
        <h3 id="favt">Some Favorite Things I've Done</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Missionary Service in Joao Pessoa, Brazil
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was one of the most fulfilling and spiritual experiences of my life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Kayaking to a bioluminecent bay
                    <ul>
                        <li>Imagine being on a kayak, in the darkness and silence of night, with nothing to guide you but the small beconing light of the lead boat
                            and the flicker of light blue bioluminecent with every disturbance of the water. My family and I took a trip together and part of the 
                            itinerary was this adventure in Puerto Rico.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Working as a Water Safety Specialist at Disney World
                    <ul>
                        <li>As far as summer jobs go, this one was definitely living the dream right out of high school. I applied for a college program that allowed 
                            me to take classes through Disney University, while getting work experience at the resorts and parks themselves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Amatuer filming Projects with Friends
                    <ul>
                        <li>I greatly value my friendships and I have a particular group of friends that I met after a somewhat difficult time in my life. They really helped 
                            as we spent time together on these projects, there was a bond forged that I will never forget.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3 id="favp">Some Favorite Places I've Been</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Latter-day Saint Temple in Sao Paulo, Brazil
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have a Mission companion who lives in Sao Paolo. I've been back to visit her a few times now, and every time I go, we spend time at the Temple in Sao Paulo.
                            It has come to have special meaning for me as I look back on those experiences, especially since we live so far apart. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, South Korea
                    <ul>
                        <li>My baby sister and I traveled to Korea in 2024. We spent all of our time in Seoul, and one of the places that I especially remember is the Royal Gyeongbokgung Palace.
                            At the back of the palace grounds is a Secret Garden. An area that was once restricted to the royal family but is now open to tourists. I was able to find special meaning 
                            and peace there, even amidst the chaos of summer attraction. It is an expereince I will never forget.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>St. Thomas Island in the Caribbean
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first stop on a family cruise to the Caribbean islands. We visited the beautiful Coco Beach, and tried conche for the first time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Haarlem City, Amsterdam
                    <ul>
                        <li>This place was the epitome of old time classic Europe. The buildings, the weather, the people. I could almost believe I was in the past as I watched the windmill blades turn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
